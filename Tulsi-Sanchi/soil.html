         what is soil?
      </h2>
      <p>
         Soil is formed as a result of the weathering process.
         Soil is a mixture of humus and rock particles. It is
         one of the natural resources and provides plants all
         its nutrients required during photosynthesis. It is the
         natural habitat of many living organisms and is essential 
         in agriculture. Soil consists of different layers such as:

         <li>Humus</li>
         <li>Water</li>
         <li>Clay</li>
         <li>Sand</li>
         <li>Gravel</li>

         <li>clayey soils</li>
         <li>loamy soil</li>
         <li>sandy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
         Formation of soil is affected by external factors such as temperature, wind, rainfall, 
         humidity, sunlight. These factors are crucial in bringing about changes in the texture 
         and quality of the soil. The type of crop that would be grown using a particular type of 
         soil is determined by the components of soil and climatic influence of a region.
